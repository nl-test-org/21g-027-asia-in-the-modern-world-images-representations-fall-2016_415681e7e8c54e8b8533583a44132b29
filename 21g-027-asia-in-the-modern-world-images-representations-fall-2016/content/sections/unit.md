What is Visualizing Cultures?
-----------------------------

Using new technologies, Visualizing Cultures weds images and commentary to illuminate social and cultural history in innovative ways. A narrative "Core Exhibit" not only gives the historical significance of the images, but also addresses issues such as genre and medium. Each unit comes with a comprehensive curriculum and carefully annotated digital archive of images from public and private sources.

The current units address topics relating to modern Japan; future units will deal with other countries and cultures as well.
